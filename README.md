# Project 1
<h2>Project 1:</h2>
Due 3.16.2018 by 11:59pm through GitHub Classroom 
Projects may be submitted up to 3 days late, with a 10% penalty per day.

<h2>Overview: </h2>
You've been provided with a dataset from the National Center for Women in Technology (NCWIT) exploring enrollments in Computing & Engineering disciplines over time. The goal of the project is to create visualizations that allow the stakeholders to effectively explore this data to answer different questions related to the diversity and inclusivity initiatives of NCWIT. 

<h2>Minimum Requirements:</h2> 
Your project must:
<ul>
<li> Include a README.md file that outlines:
  <ul>
  <li>Information about your visualizations and what they show. Include information about interactions as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Your design process (e.g., how did you go about designing, building, and refining your system? Why did you choose these representations?)</li>
  <li>Your team roles for each individual</li>
  <li>How to run your project</li></ul></li>
<li>Include at least three unique visualizations:
  <ul>
  <li>One visualization must include some element of time</li>
  <li>One visualization must not include any elements of time</li>
  <li>Each visualization must be interactive</li>
  <li>Your set of three visualizations should support at least one meaningful comparison between related data attributes</li>
  <li>Your set of three visualizations should visualize at least five data attributes total</li></ul></li>
<li>Be able to work with any dataset of this format (e.g., the numbers are interchangable but the columns and document titles are fixed).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Above and Beyond:</h2> 
The above requirements are the minimum for a passing grade on this project. Some ideas to improve your project include:<ul>
<li>Dashboarding: Show all three visualizations as part of the same screen.</li>
<li>Added Visualizations: Provide more than three visualizations</li>
<li>Dynamic Queries: Including UI widgets that allow you to change the current data field</li>
<li>Missing Data: Not all rows have data for all columns. Design ways of handling missing data intelligently.</li>
<li>Coordinated Views: Have two or more visualizations that interact with one another as you move through the data.</li>
<li>Overview+Detail: Provide a pair of views that allow viewers to retain context as they navigate your data.</li>
<li>Style: Keep the style consistent across all your views, with an eye towards intelligently applying visual design.</li></ul>

<h2>Platforms:</h2> 
You can use any development platform you'd like so long as it is not proprietary (exception: MatLab as we have a University License). Your project readme should include step-by-step instructions on how to run your projects and it should run without me having to modify the code. You are welcome to use different platforms for each visualization.

Some platforms to look at include:
<ul>
<li>D3</li>
<li>R with ggplot</li>
<li>WebGL or Three.js</li>
<li>Processing or ProcessingJS</li>
<li>Google Maps API</li>
<li>Open Street Map API</li>
<li>Bokeh</li>
<li>Creatively engineered tangible/audio artifacts</li>
</ul>

If you would like to use a platform that will push you in creative ways but may not support all of the requirements of the project, please come talk to me. 

<h2>Submissions:</h2>
All submissions must be made through GitHub with a timestamp by 11:59pm on 3.16. Your submission files should include:
<ul>
<li>Your README</li>
<li>Your code and/or project</li>
</ul>
Note that each group only needs to submit one file. 

Each member of the team should also send me a project post-mortem through email with the subject line "INFO 4602/5602: Project 2" documenting the following:
* What you worked on in the project
* What your teammates worked on in the project
* How you would rate your performance and why
* How you would rate each teammates' performance and why

These documents will be kept confidential and will factor into project grades. If you feel all of the team worked hard and performed well, please don't hesitate to tell me that (no curving is necessary on performance reviews :-))! Also, please keep in mind that different team members have different skillsets, roles, and experiences.

<h2>Grading: </h2>
The project will be scored out of 100 points total. Your project will be graded on four different criteria:
<ol>
<li> Creativity</li>
<li> Technical execution</li>
<li> Design (both aesthetic and your visualization choices)</li>
<li> Project Post-Mortems</li>
</ol>
